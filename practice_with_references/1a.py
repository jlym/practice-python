# Numbers -------------------------

# Numbers in python are immutable objects.  When you perform an operation 
# with a number, you are creating a new number object. 

# What gets printed?
# Can you sketch out the objects that get created when each line is run?

# Ex 1a

a = 1
b = a
a = a + 1

print(a)
print(b)
