# Strings ---------------------------

# Strings in python are also immutable objects.  When you perform an operation 
# with a string, you are creating a new string object. 

# What gets printed?
# Can you sketch out the objects that get created when each line is run?

# Ex 2a

a = "apple"
b = a
a = "banana"

print(a)
print(b)
